\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Python was conceived by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980’s at Centrum Wiskunde and Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, data analysis, data visualization and for task automation. Python is an object-oriented programming language and it is easy to learn. It is an interpreted and interactive programming language. Python is used by some popular companies such as Netflix, Facebook and Spotify. Some apps such as Google’s YouTube as well as Pinterest and Instagram are also written in python.}{1}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{IDE’s for Python are sublime Text 3, Pycharm, Vim, IDLE etc. Python’s object-based subset is roughly equivalent to JavaScript. Python supports a programming style that uses simple functions and variables without engaging in class definitions.Python is also used by IBM (International Business Machines) and NASA.Although python is slow and not really suitable for mobile development and games as well as mobile computing, it is a very productive language that is portable and easy to learn and write.}{2}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The first concept of maple arose from a meeting in late 1980 at the university of Waterloo. Researchers at the university wished to purchase a computer powerful enough to run the Lisp-based computer algebra system Macsyma. Instead, they opted to develop their own computer algebra system named maple, that will run on lower cost computers. Maple can perform differential algebra and it has tools for adding user interfaces to calculations and applications. It also has tools for parallel programing. Maple is based on a small kernel, written in C, which provides the maple language. It is also the best software for symbolic computations.I like the maple programming language because it is a general purpose tool for math, data analysis, visualization and programming.Maple takes advantage of the full processing power of your computer, automatically detecting and using all available processor cores to perform many computations in parallel.}{2}{}\protected@file@percent }
